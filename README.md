# Stacks-in-C
## Introduction
Stacks are a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks are widely used in various applications such as expression evaluation, function call management, undo mechanisms, and more. Implementing stacks in C involves defining operations to manipulate the stack's elements and managing its underlying data structure.<br>

In C, stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. Arrays offer simplicity and constant-time access to elements, while linked lists provide flexibility in terms of dynamic memory allocation and size management. In this file stacks is implemented using arrays.<br>

## Functionalities
The fundamental operations by stack include:<br>

Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.<br>
Pop: Removes the top element from the stack.<br>
Peek: Returns the value of the top element without removing it.<br>
isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.<br>
isFull: Checks if the stack is full.<br>
Display: Displays the stack.<br>
These operations enable efficient manipulation of stack elements and facilitate various stack-based applications.<br>
